For this homework we were tasked with creating a website for our portfolio, about, and contact pages. 
Overall I have to admit that my time management for this project was not amazing. I saved too much work for the very end and it has more than
stressed me out. In the future I will have to make sure to stay on top of my work.
The project itself was not too difficult, although trouble shooting when areas broke or would not work was frustrating. I am thankful for
bootstrap however, because I cannot imagine making this all from scratch. That would take way more time then we had.
Bootstrap has made CSS far far easier, and I am glad we have it as a tool.

I look forward for our next section(s) of class because we are tackling Javastrip, which I am excited to learn.
